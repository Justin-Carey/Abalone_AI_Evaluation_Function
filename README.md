# Abalone_AI_Evaluation_Function

This file is just one of the entire project, but it's one I created entirely myself. The full project can be requested.

This is the "brain" of the A.I. It looks at the game and makes a decision based on what it sees. 

This A.I. came second out of six teams in an in-class tournament.
